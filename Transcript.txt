A haunted halt

A Girl is driving to her parent’s house for the weekend. Its already past sunset and she is now in the middle of her road trip.
Girl [Driving car while talking to her mother on phone. Cars passing by in the background] I will be fine; you don’t need to worry about it okay. Mom, please, it’s been super crazy for me, I really want to have a good time with you all. [Car GPS talks]
In the middle of the highway, the car suddenly stops. [Sudden squeal of car brakes] [Eerie music 1 plays in the background]
Girl Oh Shoot! The car just stopped. Will call you back Mom! [Cuts the call]
The girl tries to start the car. [ car engine squeals]
Girl [Turning car keys] Oh man!
The girl comes out of the car. Shuts the car door and starts walking. [Footsteps and light breathing][Eerie music 1 stops. Eerie music 2 plays]
She sees a deserted house at the side of the road and walks towards it. [Running and breathing]
Girl [ Continuously knocking at the door] Hello! Is anybody home? Hello! My car just broke down. I need help!
No body opens the door. The girl thinks no body is home.
Girl [In a hopeless voice] Forget it!
Thinking that no body is home, she starts dialing her mom’s phone number but gets no response. [dialing phone number, phone rings periodically]
Suddenly, someone opens the door [Door creaks open slowly] [ Eerie music 2 stops. Horror drone starts in the background]
Girl [Entering the house] Hey thanks for opening the door. I thought nobody’s home. I just need help with my car…… Its right outside your house. [Voice lurking] …. Hello…Hello!
She starts walking inside the house.
[Water dripping continuously]
She keeps walking.
Girl [In a confused voice] Strange…
She then turns the water tap and the water stops dripping when suddenly the Clock strikes. [Old clock rings once]
Girl [Scared] Huuuh!
[old clock rings twice]
Girl [Relieved] It’s just the clock!
Suddenly a little girl runs in the hallway while giggling.
[little girl running and laughing]
Girl [Scared and shocked] Who’s that? [Loud horror sound plays and stops] ….[Pauses for a few seconds]…Look if this is some kind of  a joke, its[Stammers a bit] not funny!.....I…will better leave now..[runs towards the door]
[Door slams shut with a bang]
[Intense horror music plays and stops]
Girl [Frightened and frustrated] Open the door! I said open the door! Who’s this? Who’s doing all this? Open the door I said…[Voice drops in terror][takes deep breaths][Intense horror music plays]
[Some metal falling sound comes from upstairs]
Girl [In a deep state of terror] Who’s upstairs? [Takes heavy breaths][Intense horror music stops]
In a few seconds, her phone rings.
[Phone’s ringtone playing]
Girl [Answering the phone slowly] Hello…
As she answers the phone, a whispering voice from the other side responds.
Whispering phone voice You need help. He will help you!
[Horror beats start playing in the back ground]
[Beats intensify]
[Ghost whispers]
[Windows opens and closes]
[Glass shatters]
Girl [Banging door in the deepest state of terror] Open the door. Someone please open the door. Help. Help… [Heavy breathing]
[unknown entity approaches]
[Background horror music intensifies]
Girl [Screams loudly] [Scream echoes]
[Horror drone stops]
[Background music stops]
[Ghost whispers and stops]
