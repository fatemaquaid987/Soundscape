In this less than a minute preview, I have set the premise of my story which goes like this: 
A girl is driving to her parents’ house at night which can be figured from the sound of cars passing by and a constant drone in the background which sounds like a moving car. The fact that she is visiting her parents is evident from her conversation with her mom who is on the call while she is driving. A tense background music also starts to build up now which gives a feeling that something bad is about to happen.
In the middle of the call, the car breaks down. A sudden braking sound of the car engine makes this evident. This is where the background music also intensifies. As this happens, the girl cuts the call and tries to start the car by turning the car key on and off. The click of the keys can be heard here. After a few tries, she comes out of the car and shuts the car door. As she steps out of the car, a subtle noise of crickets chirping in the background gives a feeling of nightfall and spooky silence at the same time. Clueless about what just happened and of course frustrated, she starts walking across the road where she sees a house and runs towards it. As she is marching, her breath and footsteps are audible. In the final few seconds of the preview, the girl can be heard banging on the door and asking for help. 
The remaining three minutes of the video will show what happens to the girl inside the house. Creepy noises, sudden banging, creaky footsteps and creepy giggling will be heard followed by loud screams. 
The idea is to display and make audible all the different kinds of sounds inside a haunted house.
